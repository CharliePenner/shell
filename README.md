# shell
To start the shell, run the command "make", then run the executable "shell".
This Unix shell behaves like Bash. Most Bash commands should work in this shell.
To stop the shell, run the command "exit".

This shell was created by Charlie Penner, Danny Miranda, and Steven Roddenberry
in the COP4610 (Operating Systems) class at Florida State University, taught by
Andy Wang, PhD, in the spring semester of 2023.
