# shell
To start the shell, run the command "make", then run the executable "shell".
This Unix shell behaves like Bash, and will except _most_ Bash commands.
To stop the shell, run the command "exit".
To remove the object files and the executable created by "make", run the command
"make clean".

This shell was created by Charlie Penner, Danny Miranda, and Steven Roddenberry
in the COP4610 (Operating Systems) class at Florida State University, taught by
Andy Wang, PhD, in the spring semester of 2023.
